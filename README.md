# Pancreatic Cancer Analysis

This repository contains analysis pipelines and data processing scripts for pancreatic cancer, incorporating datasets from the CIA, TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), and ICGA (International Cancer Genome Consortium). The project aims to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of pancreatic cancer through various bioinformatics techniques.

## Datasets

- **CIA**: [Description of the CIA dataset and how it's relevant to your project]
- **TCGA**: [Description of the TCGA dataset, possibly including how to access it]
- **ICGA**: [Description of the ICGA dataset and its relevance]

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Preprocessing Data

- **Creating SE Object**: Script for converting raw data into a SummarizedExperiment object, facilitating easier manipulation and analysis in R.

```r
# Assuming you're using R
library(SummarizedExperiment)
# Code to create SummarizedExperiment object from your data
